If you're interested in designing a world in Webaverse you came to the right spot. There are currently several methods to building scenes in Webaverse.

## Manual

You can download the app and test your world locally using this [guide](../create/scenes).

## Editor

The editor is an early access tool for constructing and minting NFTs. There's a text editor with various templates for HTML NFT types and a library of assets pulled from Webaverse.

## Blender

Models in Webaverse are made with glTF binary files (.glb), which Blender 2.8+ has an export option for. You can also use the Webaverse [blender plugin](https://github.com/webaverse/blender-plugin) to export directly from Blender to the minting page. To learn how to setup the plugin click [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/docs/create/import-blender).

If your scene has lightmap bakes, you can use [hubs-blender-exporter](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-blender-exporter) and configure your nodes in the shader editor to export with a lightmap in the .glb file.

## In-game Editing

Users can drag and drop files into the [Webaverse app](https://app.webaverse.com) window to temporarily spawn them into the world. If you're in a multiplayer realm (`.realm [1-5]` typed in Discord) then the spawned objects will have persistence.


There's also an in-game builder you can use with `Z` `X` and `C` keys to switch between creating a wall, floor, and ramp.
