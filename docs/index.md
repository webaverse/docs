## ❓ What is the Webaverse?

<a href="https://webaverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Webaverse</a> is a blanket term used to describe a set of technologies that enable the use of spatial applications and objects powered by WebXR. These spatial applications are called "augs". See [`What Is Webaverse?`](about.md) for a more in-depth explanation, or read on to get started with using and developing them!

## ❓ What Are XR Packages (XRPKs)?

XR Packages (XRPKs) are creative spatial apps that run everywhere. Unlike traditional 2D applications, XRPKs exist in three dimensions and can be experienced with a desktop browser or any SteamVR compatible headset. XRPKs are created and owned by users like you! Getting started with XRPKs today is easy, keep reading below to get started, or see the more page [`What Is Webaverse?`](about.md) for a more in-depth explanation.

## ▶️ Start Using XRPKs

### From The Directory

You can browse through all the published packages at the [xrpackage.org](https://xrpackage.org/browse.html).

### From The Web

## 🎨 Create XRPKs

You can find amazing community creations from the [awesome-xrpackage](https://github.com/webaverse/awesome-xrpackage) repository on GitHub.

### Supported Asset Types

The Webaverse supports many different asset types to enable creators to easily bring their original content directly into the Webaverse ecosystem.

Currently the following file formats are supported:

- GLTF Models (_.gltf, _.glb)
- VRM 3D Avatars (.vrm)
- MagicaVoxel Models (.vox)
- WebXR sites and applications
- Unity HTML5 Exports (Experimental)

### Import Existing Creations

Any content creation platform that can export to one of these formats can be easily packaged and brought into the Webaverse. To get you started we've written some guides that document the process of exporting and packaging content from some popular creation platforms

**I want to package my creations from...** (**_coming soon!_**)

- [~~Tiltbrush~~](index.md)
- [~~SculptVR~~](index.md)
- [~~Oculus Medium~~](index.md)
- [~~Google Blocks/Poly~~](index.md)
- [~~Quill~~](index.md)
- [~~SculptVR~~](index.md)
- [~~Supercraft~~](index.md)
- [~~Anyland~~](index.md)

In addition to supporting traditional 3D models, Webaverse can also package WebXR sites written in Three, Babylon, or any other WebXR compatible JavaScript framework! For more information on packaging an aug from an existing WebXR site, see the [`Create Your First Aug`](creating-an-aug.md) guide to get started.

## 🦸 Developers

Are you a JavaScript developer who wants to build spatialized applications for Webaverse? Check out [our developer guides](getting-started.md) for more information on getting started with building functional XRPKs that bring your visions into reality!

The Webaverse ecosystem is built on existing open web standards like WebXR, IPFS, and Ethereum.
